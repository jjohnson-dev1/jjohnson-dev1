Technology has always fascinated me since I was young, and that interest has shaped not only my hobbies but also my professsional journey. Beginning with a BS in Computer Science, and a concentration in CyberSecurity, I graduated from Kettering University ready to pursue a career in software development. However, I could not help but to become more and more intrigued with the world of Cyber. After five years of full stack software engineering, I decided to take that next step into cybersecurity; obtaining my security+ certification. That was only the beginning!

I'm passionate about cybersecurity and love tackling complex challenges through hands-on projects. From vulnerability management to threat detection, these projects allow me to dive deep into the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity. Please feel free to check them out and see the work I’ve put into enhancing security operations and processes!
